## [Replica](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Replica-Dataset)

In this paper, we use 7 scenes `office0, office2, office3, office4, room0, room1, room2` from the [Replica Dataset](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Replica-Dataset). We request the authors of [Semantic-NeRF](https://github.com/Harry-Zhi/semantic_nerf) to generate color images and 2D object masks with camera poses at 640x480 pixels for each of 7 scenes. Each scene has 59~93 objects with very diverse sizes. Details of camera settings and trajectories can be found in the Semantic-NeRF repository.
