## DM-SR（Ours）

To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing 3D scene dataset suitable for quantitative evaluation of geometry manipulation. Therefore, we create a synthetic dataset with 8 types of different and complex indoor rooms, called DM-SR. The room types and designs follow Hypersim Dataset. Overall, we firstly render the static scenes, and then manipulate each scene followed by second round rendering. Each scene has a physical size of about 12x12x3 meters with around 8 objects. We will keep updating it for future research in the community.
